# Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintanable Applications

![design-data-intensive-applications-book](https://griffio.github.io/public/ddia.jpg)

Chapter 1 Summary: 

Applications today tend to be more data intensive as opposed to compute intensive.

{% highlight sql %}
select *
from database
{% endhighlight %}

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
