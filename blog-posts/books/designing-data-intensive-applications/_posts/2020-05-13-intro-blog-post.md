## Book Summary  
Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today. Difficult
issues need to be figured out, such as scalability, consistency, reliability,
efficiency, and maintainability. In addition, we have an overwhelming 
variety of tools, including relational databases, NoSQL datastores, stream 
or batch processors, and message brokers. What are the right choices for your 
application? How you make sense of all these buzzwords?

In this practical and comprehensive guide, author Martin Kleppman helps you navigate
this diverse landscape by examinining the pros and cons of various technologies for 
processing and storing data. Software keeps changing, but the fundamental principles
remain the same. With this book, software engineers and architects will learn how to
apply those ideas in practice, and how to make full use of data in modern applications.
