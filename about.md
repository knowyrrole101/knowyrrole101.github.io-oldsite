# Bio:

Bay area native that was born and raised in both San Jose and South San Francisco, California.
I recently moved to Austin as of April 2016 from the Bay Area to start fresh with my wife of
2 years at the time. Our family consists of me, my wife and my daughter Amira.

I currently have an older brother that lives in San Diego, and my parents currently reside in San Jose.

# Professional Experience:
I am an experienced mobile first growth marketing expert that has 8 years experience crafting
strategies and lower level execution of direct response/brand marketing campaigns.

I have worked in various verticals, with the most experience in the mobile gaming industry. Here are a few of
the companies I have worked at previously in the Bay Area.

I have much to learn but I also am always open to sharing helping out people either looking to break into the industry 
or just looking for advice in the growth field. On the other side as an aspiring software engineer I am always looking 
to connect with experience professionals and soak up as much knowledge as possible.

# Events:
I generally am open to speaking at various events and conferences around growth. Here is a conference I spoke at
Mobile Growth House for Branch.io. I have spoken at over 12 different events all mobile related in San Francisco, and Austin. 
Generally, I have spoken at events of sizes between ten to a thousand people. This is a more intimate and casual SXSW speaking event of
around 100-150 people: [SXSW Mobile Growth House hosted by Branch.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyE8xtcJ0ME).
