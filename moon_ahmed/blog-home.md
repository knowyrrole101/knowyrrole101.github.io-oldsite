#### Why Blog?
I'd like to have a better understanding of the topics I am interested. I feel as though the
best way to learn is to write about, and hopefully explain correctly or learn from feedback from other people
that may be viewing by blog posts.

I plan on writing specifically on programming books, computer science topics, and the software development craft in general
as I understand it.

#### Some Python code:
```python
print('Hello World! This is a test!')  
```
