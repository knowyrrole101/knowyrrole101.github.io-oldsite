# My Ramblings

### Why Blog?
I have been working in various vertical in the technology field for just under a decade (Gaming, Travel, B2B).
Over the course of time I have worked in this field I have learned so many different things. I hope to communicate
my understandings on a broad range of topics.

I hope to write more insightful blog articles that end up with a much broader purpose than my rambling. I genuinely
hope that my blog is something that may be read by others for educational or entertainment purposes. 

I will try to separate serious articles from more light-hearted content so that it's easy to parse.

#### Some Python code:
```python
print('Hello World! This is a test!')  
```
