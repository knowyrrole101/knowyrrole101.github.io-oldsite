# Design Data Intensive Applications

![design-data-intensive-applications-book](https://griffio.github.io/public/ddia.jpg)

I recently started reading Designing Data Intensive Applications and would like to write a blog post from each major section
I run through so I can more thoroughly understand what I am reading.

A lot of the concepts are a bit over my head at this point but when stack googling some of the key concepts per chapter and
diving back into it it starts to make more sense.

The blog posts will be broken down by chapters as follows:

Chapter 1: 


{% highlight sql %}
select *
from database
{% endhighlight %}

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
